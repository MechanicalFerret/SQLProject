# SQLProject

This project was worked on with two other students, the objective being to setup a MySQL Database by ourselves making our own specifications for how the tables and data would be organized and then coding up a PHP driven website that would run search queries on the database. The main idea was to create a movie database using information extracted from IMDB allowing for users to look up movies, actors, directors, producers, and also specify more advance searching.

The objective of the site was functionality over style but there was an insentive to make a "90s style website". Most of what I did was write the search queries and help setup the HTML/CSS for the site. We made use of Bootstrap, PHP, and a little bit of javascript.
